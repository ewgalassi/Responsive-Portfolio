            <p>I originally grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area. I went to college for my undergraduate in biology from
                UC San Diego, then received my master's degree in marine biology from San Francisco State University. After
                a brief career as a biologist, I decided that I would prefer a career that I could take pride in. I chose
                to serve in the US Navy as a submarine officer for several years. I was stationed around the country before
                separating from the Navy while living in Hawaii. After leaving the Navy I began working as a recruiter, and
                then a mortgage loan officer. When I decided that the field of sales was not my desire, I became a science
                teacher. I taught high school chemistry and physics.</p>
            <p>I currently live in Texas with my wife and son. My hobbies include baking, archery, and designing websites,
                but most of my time is enjoyed with my family.</p>

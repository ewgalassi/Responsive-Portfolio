                <p>I originally grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area.  I went to college for my undergraduate in biology from UC San Diego, then received my master's degree in marine biology from San Francisco State University.  After a brief career as a biologist, I decided that I would prefer a career that I could take pride in.  I chose to serve in the US Navy as a submarine officer for several years.  I was stationed around the country before separating from the Navy while living in Hawaii.  After leaving the Navy I began working as a recruiter, and then a mortgage loan officer.  When I decided that the field of sales was not my desire, I became a science teacher.  I taught high school chemistry and physics.</p>
                <p>I currently live in Texas with my wife and son.  My hobbies include baking, archery, and designing websites, but most of my time is enjoyed with my family.</p>

#### This page is currently being transitioned out as my active portfolio.  Think of it as the Internet Explorer version of the portfolio.

This is my mobile-responsive personal portfolio.  It uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  It contains a collection of my other projects.

### How to use it
Simply click the link to access my page.  There are links to my deployed projects and also external links to my LinkedIn page.

### If there are any issues
Please contact me, as I am continually updating my projects.
